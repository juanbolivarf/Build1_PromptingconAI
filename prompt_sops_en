Build on Prompting Resources with AI
This is the base prompt that was experimented with during this build:

Context:
[Briefly explain what you're working on or what your role is. E.g.: I'm part of the operations team at a startup.]

Problem:
[Describe the current problem. What's happening that shouldn't be happening.]

Pain or Consequences:
[Explain the effects of this problem. What frustrates you, what's lost, what becomes complicated.]

Ideal Goal:
[How you'd like it to work. What result you'd want to achieve.]

Can you help me break down this problem into steps or parts to better understand how to solve it?

Problem:
I need to present the IT team's SOPs to the General Manager and the Head of Operations. I have operational clarity on the team's work, but I didn't know how to structure the content to also communicate leadership, strategic value, and vision. I was concerned it would look like a simple task list instead of a key contribution to the company's efficiency.

Conversation with ChatGPT

Context: IT Support Coordinator presenting SOPs to leadership.

Pain: Insecurity about the presentation's impact, lack of strategic narrative.

Ideal Goal: Clear, visual SOPs that connect with company objectives (automation, control, efficiency).

Key Prompt:

Can you help me break down this problem into parts and see how I can present these SOPs more clearly, professionally, and aligned with the company's vision?

This way, and with a clear structure, this is how the prompt for the AI turned out:

"I am preparing SOPs to present to the General Manager and Head of Operations of my company (a BPO). I am an IT Support Coordinator and I want these documents to show clarity, organization, vision, and alignment with strategic objectives (such as inventory control, minimal operational downtime, and automation).

Can you help me break down this problem into steps or parts to better understand how to solve it and have an effective and professional presentation?"

Once the initial responses are obtained, we can delve deeper into the conversation to get better context and insights from the language model we are using.

1. Divide the Problem
"I'm working as an IT Support Coordinator at Anchora, and I need to present the team's SOPs to the Head of Operations and the General Manager of Colombia. I already have a draft, but I'm not sure if it communicates the strategic impact well or if it's structured in the best way.

Can you help me break down this problem into steps or parts to better understand how to solve it?"

2. Explore Solutions for Each Part
"Now that I have the parts divided, what kind of solutions exist for each? Can you help me think of alternatives for each sub-problem?"

3. Prioritize Improvements
"Which of these parts seems easiest to improve first and would generate the greatest immediate impact on the presentation?"

4. Design a Simple Solution
"How could I structure a simple solution proposal for this case? Something that helps me quickly improve the presentation and convey clarity and value."

5. Deepen the Problem
"What questions should I ask myself to better understand this problem and ensure I'm addressing it from the root?"

6. Detect Friction Points
"What parts of the process (such as wording, format, focus, etc.) might be causing this friction in my presentation?"

7. Define Concrete Objectives
"What objectives could I propose to solve this problem in the short term? For example: clarity, visual design, strategic alignment..."

8. Explore Types of Solutions
"What types of solutions do you think could help me? Should I focus on improving the narrative, the visual format, or alignment with KPIs?"
