Challenge Analysis
The real problem isn't the SOPs themselves, but how to frame them strategically. You have three distinct audiences with different interests:

General Manager: ROI, operational efficiency, risk mitigation

Head of Operations: Business continuity, response times, optimized processes

Your Positioning: Demonstrate technical leadership and strategic vision

Proposed Presentation Structure
1. Strategic Framework (Strong Opening)
Vision: "Digital Transformation of IT Support"

Connection to Business Objectives: Automation ‚Üí Cost reduction, Control ‚Üí Risk mitigation, Efficiency ‚Üí Competitive advantage

Impact Metrics: Resolution time, system availability, internal satisfaction

2. Diagnosis and Opportunities
Current state vs. desired state

Identified gaps and costs of inaction

Quantified improvement opportunities

3. SOPs as Strategic Tools (Not just task lists)
Group SOPs into value categories:

Business Continuity: Backup procedures, disaster recovery

User Experience: Incident management, escalated support

Resource Optimization: Preventive maintenance, asset management

Security and Compliance: Security protocols, audits

4. Implementation Roadmap
Phases prioritized by impact

Realistic timeline

Required resources

Tracking metrics

Key Elements for Success
Value Narrative: Each SOP should answer: "How does this improve the business?"

Visualization: Flowcharts, metric dashboards, before/after

Business Language: Less technical jargon, more focus on results

Success Stories: Concrete examples where procedures prevented costly problems

Executive Template: Presentation with a "Situation ‚Üí Complication ‚Üí Resolution" structure
KPI Dashboard: Visual metrics connecting IT to business objectives
Elevator Pitch: 2-minute summary of strategic value

Diagnosis and Opportunities
Cost-benefit Analysis: ROI calculator for each SOP

Risk Matrix: Visualization of "what happens if we don't do this"

Benchmarking: Comparison with industry standards

SOPs as Strategic Tools
Visual Process Mapping: Flowcharts with KPI impact

Categorization by Value: Grouping by "Savings," "Prevention," "Growth"

Real-world Use Cases: Quantified success stories

Implementation Roadmap
Phased Methodology: Quick wins ‚Üí Structural improvements ‚Üí Transformation

Gantt Chart: Visual timeline with key milestones

Resource Matrix: Personnel, time, budget needed

üéØ 3. Prioritization by Impact
HIGHEST IMMEDIATE IMPACT: Strategic Framework

Why: It's the first thing they see, sets the entire tone.

Ease: Medium-high (requires conceptual reframing, not content recreation).

Impact: High (changes perception of the entire presentation).

SECOND: Diagnosis and Opportunities

Why: Justifies the need for SOPs.

Ease: High (data you likely already have).

Impact: High (creates urgency and buy-in).

üõ†Ô∏è 4. Simple Solution - Executive Template
20-minute Structure:

OPENING (3 min): "The challenge of scaling IT without losing control"

DIAGNOSIS (5 min): Current costs of disorganization

SOLUTION (8 min): SOPs categorized by business impact

IMPLEMENTATION (3 min): 90-day plan with quick wins

CLOSING (1 min): Next steps and necessary resources

Practical Tools:

Slide master with corporate branding

Consistent iconography (processes, metrics, timeline)

Color coding by value category

One-pager templates for each main SOP

‚ùì 5. Deep Diagnostic Questions
About the Audience:

What business metrics keep the GM and Head of Ops up at night?

What was the last operational crisis that IT could have prevented?

What strategic projects depend on IT stability?

About Your SOPs:

Which SOPs have prevented costly problems in the past?

Which current processes create the most friction with other departments?

How much time/money is lost due to a lack of clear procedures?

About Your Positioning:

How do you want to be perceived after this presentation?

What authority/resources do you need to implement improvements?

üîç 6. Detected Friction Points
In the Approach:

Friction: Thinking of SOPs as "technical documentation"

Solution: Reframe as "business growth tools"

In the Format:

Friction: Too much text, little visualization

Solution: 6x6 rule (maximum 6 bullets, 6 words each)

In the Narrative:

Friction: Starting with technical details

Solution: Start with business impact

In the Connection:

Friction: Not linking IT to strategic company objectives

Solution: Map each SOP to a business KPI
